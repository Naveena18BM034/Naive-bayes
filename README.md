# Naive-bayes
<p>Naive Bayes is a simple yet effective probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions. It is commonly used for classification tasks and is particularly useful for text classification, spam detection, and other applications where the independence assumption holds reasonably well. </p>
